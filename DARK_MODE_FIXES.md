# Dark Mode and Light Mode Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Tailwind CSS Configuration**
- **Problem**: Dark mode classes were being used throughout the components, but Tailwind wasn't configured to support dark mode.
- **Solution**: Added `darkMode: 'class'` to `tailwind.config.cjs` to enable class-based dark mode switching.

### 2. **Theme Management System**
- **Problem**: No way for users to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive theme management system:
  - `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Theme context provider with state management
  - `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` - Toggle button component with sun/moon icons
  - Automatic detection of system preference on first load
  - Persistent theme storage in localStorage

### 3. **Missing Dark Mode Styles**
- **Problem**: Several components were missing proper dark mode text colors and contrast.
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive dark mode styles to all components:

#### App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
- Added `ThemeProvider` wrapper around the entire app
- Added `ThemeToggle` component for theme switching
- Added dark mode text color to main heading

#### Question Component (`src/CancelFlow/components/Question.tsx`)
- Added dark mode text colors for headings and button text
- Improved contrast for selected and unselected states
- Added proper border styling for unselected buttons

#### FinalComment Component (`src/CancelFlow/components/FinalComment.tsx`)
- Added dark mode styles for textarea with proper focus states
- Added dark mode text colors for headings
- Improved button styling for dark mode
- Enhanced placeholder text contrast

#### FinalMessage Component (`src/CancelFlow/components/FinalMessage.tsx`)
- Added dark mode text colors for headings and descriptions
- Improved secondary text contrast from `dark:text-zinc-400` to `dark:text-zinc-300`

#### CancelFlow Component (`src/CancelFlow/CancelFlow.tsx`)
- Added proper border color for the main card container
- Improved "Never mind" button styling for dark mode from `dark:text-zinc-500` to `dark:text-zinc-300`

### 4. **Text Accessibility Improvements (Latest Update)**
- **Problem**: Text visibility was poor in dark mode, making content hard to read and not meeting accessibility standards.
- **Solution**: Enhanced text contrast ratios across all components:
  - **"Never mind" button**: Changed from `dark:text-zinc-500` to `dark:text-zinc-300` for better visibility
  - **Theme toggle icon**: Added `dark:text-zinc-300` to ensure icon visibility in dark mode
  - **Secondary text**: Improved contrast from `dark:text-zinc-400` to `dark:text-zinc-300` in final message
  - **Button borders**: Added proper border styling for unselected question options
  - **Placeholder text**: Maintained consistent `dark:placeholder:text-zinc-400` for optimal readability

### 5. **Toast Notifications**
- **Problem**: Toast notifications had hardcoded light colors that didn't work well with dark mode.
- **Solution**: Updated `src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx` to be theme-aware:
  - Dynamic styling based on current theme
  - Proper contrast for success, error, and info toasts
  - Theme-appropriate border accents

## Features Added

### Theme Toggle Button
- Fixed position in top-right corner
- Animated sun/moon icons with proper contrast
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Smooth transitions

### Automatic Theme Detection
- Detects system preference on first visit
- Remembers user preference in localStorage
- Applies theme class to document root

### Comprehensive Dark Mode Support
- All text elements have proper contrast ratios meeting WCAG guidelines
- Interactive elements (buttons, inputs) have appropriate hover states
- Consistent color scheme throughout the application
- Proper focus indicators for accessibility
- Enhanced readability for all user interface elements

## Technical Implementation

### Theme Context
```typescript
type Theme = 'light' | 'dark';
interface ThemeContextType {
  theme: Theme;
  toggleTheme: () => void;
  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void;
}
```

### Theme Persistence
- Uses `localStorage.getItem('theme')` for persistence
- Falls back to system preference: `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`
- Applies theme class to document root: `document.documentElement.classList.add(theme)`

## Usage

Users can now:
1. **Automatic**: The app detects their system preference automatically
2. **Manual**: Click the theme toggle button in the top-right corner to switch themes
3. **Persistent**: Their choice is remembered across browser sessions

## Color Scheme

### Light Mode
- Background: `bg-zinc-100` (main), `bg-white` (cards)
- Text: `text-zinc-900` (primary), `text-zinc-500` (secondary)
- Borders: `border-zinc-200`, `border-zinc-300`

### Dark Mode
- Background: `bg-zinc-950` (main), `bg-zinc-900` (cards)
- Text: `text-zinc-100` (primary), `text-zinc-300` (secondary, improved contrast)
- Borders: `border-zinc-700`
- Interactive elements: Enhanced contrast ratios for better accessibility

## Accessibility Compliance

All components now provide excellent contrast and readability in both themes, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards for:
- Text contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Interactive element visibility
- Focus indicators
- Color-independent information conveyance
