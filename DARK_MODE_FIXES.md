# Dark Mode and Light Mode Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tailwind CSS Configuration
- **Problem**: `tailwind.config.cjs` was missing `darkMode: 'class'` configuration
- **Fix**: Added `darkMode: 'class'` to enable class-based dark mode switching

### 2. Missing Dark Mode Toggle
- **Problem**: No way for users to switch between light and dark modes
- **Fix**: Added a dark mode toggle button in the top-right corner of the app with:
  - Sun icon for light mode
  - Moon icon for dark mode
  - Proper accessibility attributes
  - Theme persistence in localStorage
  - Automatic detection of system preference

### 3. Incomplete Text Color Classes
- **Problem**: Many components were missing proper text colors for dark mode
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive text color classes throughout the application:

#### App.tsx
- Added `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` to main container
- Added proper styling for the dark mode toggle button

#### Question.tsx
- Added `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` to question headings
- Added `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` to option buttons

#### FinalComment.tsx
- Added `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` to heading
- Enhanced textarea with proper colors and focus states:
  - `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` for text
  - `placeholder-zinc-500 dark:placeholder-zinc-400` for placeholders
  - `border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700` for borders
  - `bg-white dark:bg-zinc-800` for background
- Enhanced submit button with dark mode variants

#### FinalMessage.tsx
- Added `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` to main heading
- Added `text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-400` to subtitle

#### CancelFlow.tsx
- Added `dark:text-zinc-500 dark:hover:text-blue-400` to the "Never mind" button

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Theme Persistence**: User's theme preference is saved to localStorage
- **System Preference Detection**: Automatically detects if user prefers dark mode
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added transition classes for better visual feedback
- **Focus States**: Enhanced focus states for better accessibility
- **Proper Contrast**: Ensured proper contrast ratios in both light and dark modes
